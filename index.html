        Does she need to be an empathetic leader? Ask about that. Does she need to
        take your company public? Ask about that. If you're the candidate, talk about why
        you took certain jobs. Explain why you left. Explain why you chose a certain
        school. Share why you decided to go to grad school. Discuss why you took a year
        off to backpack through Europe, and what you got out of the experience. What
        are your biggest weaknesses? Every candidate knows how to answer this
        question: Just pick a theoretical weakness and magically transform that flaw into
        a strength in disguise! For example: "My biggest weakness is getting so absorbed
        in my work that I lose all track of time. Every day I look up and realize everyone
        has gone home! I know I should be more aware of the clock, but when I love what
        I'm doing I just can't think of anything else." So your "biggest weakness" is that
        you'll put in more hours than everyone else? Great. What are your biggest
        strengths? I'm not sure why interviewers ask this question; your resume and
        experience should make your strengths readily apparent! Even so, if you're asked,
        provide a sharp, on-point answer. Be clear and precise! If you're a great problem
        solver, don't just say that: Provide a few examples, pertinent to the opening,
        that prove you're a great problem solver! If you're an emotionally intelligent
        leader, don't just say that!
